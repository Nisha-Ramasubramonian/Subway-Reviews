# Subway-Reviews
Problem Set-up: Subway CEO John Chidsey received a report from his field officer that customers are unhappy with one of its stores in Milford, CT, where Subway is headquartered. Upon checking the online reviews for this store, he finds that the average rating received by the store is 3.2/5. John is concerned that if a store next to the headquarters is at 3.2/5, stores farther away might be performing even more poorly. John calls for an urgent meeting with the Head of Customer Service, the Head of Store Operations, the Head of Social Media, and the Chief Data Scientist (your boss). He
expresses his concern and urges the team to take measures to improve the average
ratings received across all stores in the U.S. to 4.5/5. His team tells him not to worry by making the following statements:
     - Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 
       4.5/5.”
     - Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from 
       poor customer ratings.”
     - Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only 
       small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
     - Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only 
       when they are either extremely angry or absolutely delighted with the service. So online 
       ratings are not reliable.
