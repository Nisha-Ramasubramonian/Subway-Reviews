# Subway-Reviews
Problem Set-up: Subway CEO John Chidsey received a report from his field officer that customers are unhappy with one of its stores in Milford, CT, where Subway is headquartered. Upon checking the online reviews for this store, he finds that the average rating received by the store is 3.2/5. John is concerned that if a store next to the headquarters is at 3.2/5, stores farther away might be performing even more poorly. John calls for an urgent meeting with the Head of Customer Service, the Head of Store Operations, the Head of Social Media, and the Chief Data Scientist (your boss). He
expresses his concern and urges the team to take measures to improve the average
ratings received across all stores in the U.S. to 4.5/5.
